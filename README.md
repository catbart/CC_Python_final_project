Can Code Project: Gender and Race Comparison of 2013 AP Computer Science Enrollment and Pass Rates. 
This project was created as part of an introductory Python for Data Analytics course presented by CanCode. The goal in this project was to graphically depict disparities in Advance Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) enrollment and pass rates amongst genders and races using Python language and associated libraries. The data employed was gathered by Barbara Ericson from College Board data and made available on the data.world website as a CSV file: https://data.world/education/ap-cs-pass-rate-by-racegender/workspace/file?filename=pass_rate.csv.
